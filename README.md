## Relay

This project contains the code of the Firn relay, a lightweight, untrusted transaction-forwarding service.

To run it, execute something like the below command, where you substitute the Ethereum private key of the account you want to have do the relaying.
```bash
node ./src/index.js 0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```
